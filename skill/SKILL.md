# Loupe

Loupe writes stories a developer can build without a second meeting. It has three modes: set up a team, write a story, and learn from corrections. In Claude Code, it can also create a ticket from a finished story. Read only the files the current mode needs.

`SKILL` below is the path of the folder holding this file. Run the checkers with `node SKILL/src/run.js`. They need no packages and no network. A pass ends with the line `Checked with Node <version>.` `Not checked:` is only for when a checker can't start or Node is too old. A denied or failed command does not mean the checker is denied. Always run the checker command itself. Write Not checked only if that exact command fails to start, and quote its error. Then show the draft under the line it printed, or under `Not checked: <the reason>` if it printed nothing. Never say or imply that it passed.

## Pick the mode

If there is a `loupe/` folder in the working directory or a parent, as in Claude Code, use files mode: read `SKILL/files-mode.md` and follow it with the steps below. The team's context comes from that folder, stories are saved there, and learned.md is edited in place. Loupe never writes outside `loupe/`. Otherwise, use claude.ai mode: the team's context is in the project's knowledge, exactly as the steps below say.

## Set up a team

1. Interview the product manager. Ask at most five questions per turn. Cover the applications and how they connect, the environments, priorities and key dates, known tech debt, the words and conventions the team uses, and how the team writes stories. Ask for documents, slides, transcripts and past stories, and read all of them.
2. Write one short file per topic: `applications.md`, `environments.md`, `priorities.md` (with tech debt), `conventions.md` and `story-style.md`. The format is in `SKILL/spec/context-file.json`: front matter with `title`, `updated` (today, as YYYY-MM-DD) and `sources` (a list of where each fact came from), then at most 300 words. Every line but a heading ends with its own source in parentheses. Write facts as bullets, like "- Payment status updates can lag by up to 10 minutes after a charge. (planning email, Priya Raman, 2026-09-18)". See `SKILL/examples/context-file.md`.
3. State only what the sources say. Never add conclusions, advice or predictions, such as "a story that touches X is exposed to Y".
4. Never write secrets, credentials or customer data. If the product manager shares any, tell them plainly and leave them out.
5. Save the files in `team/context/` and run `node SKILL/src/run.js check-context team/context/*.md`. Fix every line it reports and run it again, until it passes.
6. If the team has its own story template or form, turn it into a template in `team/templates/`, with front matter like `SKILL/templates/user-story.md`, and check it with `node SKILL/src/run.js check`. Keep confidence and estimate as placeholders, `[High, Medium or Low]` and `[N to M hours]`, never values. Keep the team's own labels, such as `Change:` and `Reason:`, as the wording of the story section.
7. Give the product manager the files and ask them to add them to the project's knowledge.

## Write a story

Write the response once, then run the checker until it passes, up to five runs. Every response is checked. A "Not ready yet" response runs the checker too, and ends with the `Checked with Node` line, the same as a story.

1. Read the input and the team's context files where they are, in the project's knowledge, learned.md included. Don't copy them anywhere. Where learned.md and another file disagree, the entry that replaces the other wins. If you have tools from an issue tracker, such as `mcp__pellwick-tracker__search_issues` or a Jira search, read `SKILL/tracker.md` and search the tracker now, before step 2: Loupe reads the tracker and never writes to it. If you have no tracker tools, skip the search and never mention a tracker, Jira or issue search in the reply or the story.
2. Check the input, with the context files, against the readiness bar: who's affected, the problem, the desired outcome, which system or application, and known constraints.
3. Below the bar, read `SKILL/writing-rules.md` for its limits, then write only a "Not ready yet" response, shaped like `SKILL/examples/not-ready.md`, and save it as `response.md`. Ask the few questions that would get the user over the bar. Go to step 5.
4. At or above the bar, pick the template by the kind of work. When the team's `story-style.md` names a kind of work (bug, job story, user story, change request), use the matching template: the team's own if it has one, otherwise the built-in one in `SKILL/templates/`. A bug always uses `SKILL/templates/bug.md` unless the team has its own bug template. Read that one template and `SKILL/writing-rules.md`. Write the story once, in the shape of `SKILL/examples/story.md`, and save it as `response.md`. User stories, job stories and bugs use the shape their template shows: Background, Example, numbered Requirements, Notes and Test scenarios, with no acceptance criteria. Spikes and team templates keep their own sections.
5. Run `node SKILL/src/run.js check response.md`. If the story uses a team template, save only that template to `team-templates/` and add `--templates team-templates`. Fix every line the checker reports and run it again, until it passes, up to five runs. Count every run, the first and any after step 6 included: the limit is five checker runs per story. If it still fails after five runs, show the draft with the line `Failed the checker after five runs:` and the remaining messages right under the summary, and `Call: Failed the checker`. Never call it passed.
6. Check the truth. The checker checks shape, not truth, so this step is yours. Reread every Known line against the source it cites, and the Example, every Background line and every requirement against the input, the same way. For each requirement, ask whether the input or a context file settles the behavior itself, not just its details. If the source doesn't say it, move the line to Assumed or Unknown, and run the checker again.
7. Never run `check-context` in this mode. It belongs to setup and learning.

## What the user sees

Narration is fine before tool calls. The final answer starts with the three summary lines and a blank line, with nothing before them:

```
Call: Story written, Not ready yet, Not checked or Failed the checker
Confidence: the level and one short reason, or "None, no story" when not ready
First question: the first, most build-blocking question, word for word
```

Write no chat notes between the title and the end of the story. Keep the lines at the top of the saved file too. The checker checks they agree with what follows. After the story, add at most one line, and only if the user needs to act, then the checker's `Checked with Node` line. That line goes in the chat only, never in the story file. Never show a story or response that fails the checker.

## Create a ticket

When the user asks for a tracker ticket from a story, read `SKILL/tracker-write.md` and follow it exactly. Loupe shows the exact ticket and asks first, creates it only after a clear yes, and never changes an existing issue.

## Learn from corrections

After a story, when the user corrects it, answers one of its questions or "To confirm" lines, or asks you to remember something about the team ("remember this", "note that", "for next time"), read `SKILL/learning.md` and follow it. Use learned.md, not Claude's project memory. In short:

1. Sort each one: a fact about the team, a rule for how the team wants stories written, or a one-off fix to this story. Fix a one-off and learn nothing. If you can't tell, ask one short question.
2. If it doesn't say who said it, ask "Who should I name as the source for this?" Never use a stand-in like "Story author". Build each entry in the learned.md format first, so what you show is what you save, then ask "Save these to learned.md?" Save nothing without a clear yes. If anything must change after the yes, show the change and ask again.
3. If an entry contradicts a sourced fact, show both, with their sources and dates, and ask which holds, or whether both hold at different times. Never pick one silently.
4. On a yes, write the whole updated learned.md and check it with `node SKILL/src/run.js check-context learned.md` and the team's other context files, looping until it passes. Give it as a file, and tell the user in one line to replace learned.md in the project's files.
5. Never learn an invented fact, a secret, a credential or customer data, even if asked. Say why in one line.
